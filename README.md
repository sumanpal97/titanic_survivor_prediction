## Overview

The **Titanic Survivor Prediction** project aims to predict the likelihood of passengers surviving the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. By analyzing historical passenger data, we build a machine learning model that predicts survival outcomes based on various features such as passenger class, age, gender, and fare.

## Key Steps and Components

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather data from the provided CSV file (`train.csv`).
   - The dataset contains information about passengers, including their survival status, class, age, gender, and other relevant attributes.

2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values.
   - Key steps in data cleaning include:
     - Imputing missing age values based on passenger class (mean imputation).
     - Removing the "Cabin" column due to excessive missing data.
     - Mapping the "Embarked" column to binary features ("S," "C," and "Q").

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Engineer new features to enhance model performance:
     - Create binary features for the embarkation ports ("S," "C," and "Q").
     - Extract relevant information from passenger names (e.g., titles like "Mr." or "Mrs.").

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize relationships between features and survival using plots (e.g., box plots, heatmaps).
   - Investigate correlations and patterns (e.g., survival rates by passenger class, age, and gender).

5. **Machine Learning Model Building:**
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, decision tree).
   - Train the model using features like age, gender, class, and embarkation details.
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Model Evaluation and Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   - Cross-validate the model to ensure robustness.
   - Use metrics like ROC curves and AUC to assess performance.

7. **Predictions and Deployment:**
   - Apply the trained model to predict survival probabilities for passengers in the test dataset.
   - Prepare submission files for Kaggle competitions or other evaluation platforms.
